# Robby Russell theme for Git-Bash
A Git-Bash theme inspired from robbyrussell theme for zsh shell.

Steps for use(Windows):
1. Download git-prompt.sh.
2. Navigate to 'C:\Program Files\Git\etc\profile.d'.
3. Replace the original git-prompt.sh.
4. Now you should be good to go!

I'm currently using Hyper with Git-Bash. Here's the Screenshot!

Most of the code is the original code from git-prompt.sh with some minor changes.
